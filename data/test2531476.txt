Question: NOTTING HILL CARNIVAL
Notting Hill Carnival takes place in London every August bank holiday, and is the most colourful and largest street event in the UK. The festival celebrates the traditions of the Afro-Caribbean community, who emigrated to England from the West Indies in the 1950s. They brought with them the Caribbean idea of the carnival, with colourful costumes, processions, steel bands and street dancing. Preparations for the carnival start many months in advance. Costumes need to be made, and floats built, ready for the carnival street procession. Steel bands practise traditional Caribbean music on instruments built from used oil barrels. Just before the festival, the streets are decorated with yellow, green and red streamers, and amplifying devices are set in place, to carry the rhythmic sounds over the roar of the London traffic. The carnival is celebrated over three days, and is full of music and colour. Processions of steel and brass bands, floats, and dancers in colourful costumes make their way through the narrow London streets, watched by tens of thousands of people. The streets are lined with stalls selling tropical fruits, such as fresh mangoes, watermelons and pineapple. Everyone dances - young and old, black and white - and even the policemen on duty take part in the fun. For these three days in August, a little Caribbean magic touches the streets of London.
