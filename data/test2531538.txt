One day, Jerry had a great new idea. It was Superman! Superman is from another planet, but nobody knows. He lives like an ordinary person. Superman does good things for people. He is a hero. Joe drew Superman. Joe and Jerry wanted to sell their story. They wanted to make money, but nobody bought Superman. Finally, after many years, someone wanted to buy Superman. Jerry and Joe were very excited, but they sold Superman for only a little money. Superman became a great success. 
In 1975, Joe could not see well. He could not draw. He lived in a small apartment. Jerry worked for very little money. The two men were both old and poor. They were angry, too.
