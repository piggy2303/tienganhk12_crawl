Question: Read the text and questions below. For each question, choose the correct answer.
Imagine if everyone in your street suddenly came out into the road one day and started singing together. Singing teacher Ruth Black believes it would make everyone so friendly that they would never walk past each other again without saying hello.
Singing helps people live in peace together, she says. All over the world people have always sung together and in most places they still do, but in England, it is no longer traditional. Nowadays, says Ruth, people only sing together in churches and football grounds, although it could be done anywhere. Everyone is able to sing, she says, but most of us either think we can't or have forgotten what we learned as children.
However, as with everything musical, you need to practice and the same applies to your voice. Ruth believes that singing itself brings other benefits. It encourages good breathing, for example. Through singing, people often become more confident and also learn to control stress. But more than anything, it brings people together.
When Ruth first started singing, there was little opportunity to sing with others. Then, through a friend, she discovered an excellent singing class and became so keen that she started running her own classes. These are held twice a month for all singers, whatever their level, and are now enormously successful.
