Question: Read the following passage and choose the correct answer to each of the questions.
English is one of the most popular languages in the world. It comes second in the number of speakers after Chinese. In Vietnam, more and more people are studying English, and they consider it a key to success. However, not everyone knows how to learn English effectively.
The best way to improve the four skills: speaking, listening, reading and writing, is to practice regularly. You should make use of every opportunity to speak English with friends in class or at English speaking clubs or even with yourselves in front of the mirror.

Reading books, listening to the radio and watching films are better ways to memorize words. Besides, English learners should not be so shy because making mistakes is unavoidable in learning foreign languages. Practicing speaking a lot is a good way to correct your mistakes.
